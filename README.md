CR-10 3D Printer Modification

This is a modification of the CR-10 S4 3D printer. It is a complete change to the Y X and Z axis to imitate the Prusa style printer specifically the Prusa MK2 and MK3 range. The main things provided by this modification are the parts for the Y and Z axis. THe X axis can be parts from the Prusa, Zaribo and Bear range of pruse printers and modifications. There are 8mm and 10mm veriants of the Z axis. To be able to use the 10mm Z and or X axis currently you would need to use the Z and or X axis of Zaribo printer.

The required parts are the same as the 8mm veriant except for the X axis when using the Zaribo parts for 10mm rods the lenght is 420mm.

Firmware

Is not currently provided as there can be differences in the mainboards used. I am personally using an SKR 1.4 Turbo and the firmware created by Chris Warkocki for the Bear can be used with changes to the axis lengths.
